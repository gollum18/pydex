# pydex
A Python3 implementation of various database indexing techniques generalized for use elsewhere.


## What is this?
'pydex' - Python Index - Is a collection of useful modules and classes for building generic indicies over data collections.
The techniques implemented by this package are employed in some way, shape, or form for index management in 100% of the database systems
on the planet (per my Professor). This package is intended to provide myself with a deep understanding of the fundamentals of modern
database and file indexing.

The following indexing methods are planned for implementation:
- B+ Tree Indexing
- ~~Dynamic Hashing
- Extendible Hashing
- Linear Hashing

The following indexing methods have been completed:
- Dynamic Hashing
